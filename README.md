# Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy 

Here is my solution for this Code challenge. 

# Problem
The problem reads as follows....

# Assumptions 
    - Type new notes in new lines. 
    - There are 3 kinds of formats of notes that will be reconized and they are:
        - number equivalence: "galactic_digit is  roman_digit"
        - exchange rate: "galactic_number resource is arabic_number credits"
        - querries:  "how much is galactic_number ?" or "how many credits is galactic_number resource"
    Please use this format and mind the gaps. These are all examples of valid input formats:
        - 'glob is I'
        - 'how much is pish tegj glob glob ?'
        - 'glob glob Silver is 34 Credits\n
           how many Credits is glob prok Silver'
